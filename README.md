# School_District_Analysis
An analysis of Students' performance on standardized tests to reform school budgeting and priorities,&lt;br> using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and haved requested to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
Once the data in question is replaced, The Board would like a repeat of the school district analysis and a comparison of the results before and after the change. 

## Objectives
* Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
* Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis (README.md)

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv, clean_students_complete.csv
- Software: Anaconda (4.11.0), Python (3.7.6).
- Libraries and Packages: Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter notebook.

## Summary of Analysis Results

### Repeat the school district analysis
Repeat the school district analysis you did in this module, and recreate the following metrics:
